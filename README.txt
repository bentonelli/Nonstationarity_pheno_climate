General outline and overview:
The code here is used to estimate arrival dates for North American migratory birds using eBird data, and than compare those arrival dates to environmental covariates derived from Daymet. This code contains three sections, the first ("1_Prepare_data") is used to filter the global eBird database to North America and according to certain checklists standards, split the data by year, and than use that data to estimate arrival dates for species in specific locations. This section also includes code to download environmental covariates via Daymet using the associated R package "daymetr", which is then combined into a single dataset. Note that to run this section, users will need to request and download the eBird dataset (see link below). Therefore, this section of code is not self-contained.

Section 2 ("2_Main_analysis") includes code to format the data to be analyzed via a single Bayesian hierarchical model (also included in this section). The code to run the main analysis is included in this section as well. This section of code is self-contained, as the data used in the analysis is included in the data folder.

Section 3 ("3_Output_analysis") contains code to get posterior estimates from the model, and to reproduce figures presented in the associated publication.
